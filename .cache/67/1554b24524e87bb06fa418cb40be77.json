With the rise of music-streaming platforms, listeners can play the majority of songs ever made by anyone for free. Spotify — with 232 million monthly users and 108 million paying subscribers globally — leads the pack.</p>\n    <p class=\"body-text serif\">Whatever your appetite, music unites fans across countries. And wherever you are, Spotifiy keeps track of it all. The service publishes daily top song charts for 60-plus countries around the world. </p>\n    <p class=\"body-text serif\">So how do these countries stack up against each other?

Songs in this space have racked up billions of streams on Spotify. Many also pointed to a Latin music boom in the U.S. following Luis Fonsi’s 2017 hit “Despacito.”</p>\n    <p class=\"body-text serif\">In June, many countries throughout Central and South America (plus Mexico and Spain) were listening to the same artists: Bad Bunny, a Puerto Rican Latin trap and reggaeton singer; Sebastian Yatra, known for Latin pop and reggaeton; and Paulo Londra, an Argentinian rapper and latin trap artist, among others.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"story-body\">\n    <h3 class=\"section-head serif\">Brazil stands alone</h3>\n    <p class=\"body-text serif\"> Brazil’s top songs were almost completely different from those in the rest of Latin America.</p>\n    <p class=\"body-text serif\">Part of the reason is Brazil’s unique history. The former Portuguese colony is the lone speaker of the language in the region. Many of its popular genres are unique to the nation: bossa nova and samba, to name just a few.</p>\n    <p class=\"body-text serif\">Sertanejo, a type of Brazilian pop music evolved out of local folk music, has been the most played music genre on Brazilian radio since the 1990s, constantly topping the Brazilian music charts.</p>\n    <p class=\"body-text serif\">In June, Brazilian sertanejo artist, Marília Mendonça, dominated the country’s top song chart with 15 tracks. Songs from other Brazilian sertanejo artists such as Zé Neto & Cristiano and Gusttavo Lima also topped Brazil's chart, but nowhere else.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"button\">\n  <button id=\"hello\"><a href=\"https://github.com/AmyOKruk/Spotify_charts_analysis\">View the code</a></button>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"footer\">\n    <p class=\"note\">Data and methods:</p>\n    <!-- <p class=\"note\">Canada's<a href=\"https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=PR&Code1=01&Geo2=&Code2=&SearchText=Canada&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1&type=0\"> 2016 census data.</a></p> -->\n    <p class=\"note\">To collect the data, I scraped Spotify’s Top 200 songs per country for the week of 06/21/2019 to 06/28/2019.</p>  \n    <p class=\"note\">Spotify’s top song charts heavily favour countries from North America and Europe.
